						“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
						structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was
						encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
						about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
						hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
						particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
						tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
						example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
						developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
